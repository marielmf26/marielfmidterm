<h1>About Photography</h1>

<p>Photography is the art, application and practice of creating</br>durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of</br>an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material</br> such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science,</br> manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its</br> more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational</br> purposes, hobby, and mass communication.[1]</br>
Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from</br> objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a</br> camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this</br> produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically</br> processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent</br> display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an</br>invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a</br> visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of</br> the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative</br> image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a</br> positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using</br> an enlarger or by contact printing.</p>

<h2>The Evolution Of Photography</h2>

<p>It started with a box until about 190 years ago when Joseph Nicephore</br> Niepce produced what is believed to be the oldest surviving</br> photograph from a window of his estate in Le Gras in the Burgundy region</br> of France. We’ll talk more about Joe in just a little bit.</br> However, the beginnings of photography reach back further than that…</br> much, much, much further back. We’re talking about an entirely</br> different millennium.</br>
Let’s stop here for just a moment in order to admit that as with many</br> monumental discoveries and inventions there are protestations and</br> controversies surrounding some of the events that will be recounted</br> here. Still, I will always do everything I can to at least mention all</br> involved parties in order to give credit where it is most certainly due.</br>
It all most likely began in China with an alarmingly simple apparatus</br> called the “camera obscura”. It’s name is derived from Latin which</br>means “dark chamber” (how great is that?) and we can trace back</br> references to this device as as the fourth century BCE. A camera obscura</br> is a box of virtually any size which has a hole of small diameter</br> in one side which allows light to pass. The light then casts itself on</br>the inside of the box thus making an inverted image.</p>
