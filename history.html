<h2>The History Of Photography</h2>

<p>Fast forward about 2,200 years. It is around 1826 and we find</br> ourselves back with Joseph Nicephore Niepce. He is looking out his</br> window and he is about to make a photograph… well, a heliograph, to be</br> exact.</br>
This was around the time Niepce produced what is believed to be the</br> oldest surviving photograph from a window of his estate located in Le</br> Gras in the Burgundy region of France. What Mr. Niepce concocted was a</br> small piece of polished pewter which he then coated with a</br> solution of bitumen and lavender oil. Bitumen is a naturally occurring</br> asphalt and is sometimes referred to as Bitumen of Judea. The most</br> interesting property of bitumen is that it is light sensitive.</br>
So, for what has been speculated from anywhere between eight hours to</br> several days, the piece of polished pewter with bitumen emulsion</br> remained in Joe’s camera obscura. What resulted was this:</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Niepce partnered with a Parisian artist</br> named Louis Daguerre and began further investigations and refinements</br> into Niepce’s process. Sadly, Niepce passed away in 1833 but luckily</br> left his notes entirely to Daguerre who continued working. Louis</br> favored a silver-based processes and used plates with silver coatings</br> which were exposed to iodine fumes. The iodine reacted with the</br> silver and produced a coating of photosensitive silver iodide on the</br> plates.</br>
The major innovation of Daguerre’s process was the discovery that by</br> applying mercury fumes to the exposed silver plate he could actually</br> make the “latent” image visible on the plate thus reducing the lengthy</br> exposure times of previous methods. Now, exposures could be</br> measured in minutes instead of days. Daguerre’s method of silver iodide</br> emulsed plates developed with mercury vapor was called… you guessed</br> it… the Daguerreotype. These instructions were then published as a</br> free gift to the world on August 19th, 1839.</p>
