<h2>Today's Photography</h2>

<p>Give the digital camera revolution about ten or fifteen years to stew</br> and now we find ourselves landed here in the present. We trudge</br> knee-deep through swamps of the newest cameras and lenses and any</br> other piece of gear we can dream into reality. Imagine the reaction of</br> Niepce if he saw the ease by which photographs are now taken</br> instantly on the street. No more bulky camera obscuras. Without plates</br> or film or chemicals. Just press the button..</p>

<h3>The Digital Age</h3>

<p>Does this ease of production outway the quality of production?</br> Without a doubt, the majority of those 800+ trillion photos we made last</br> year will not be pieces of treasured art or make their way onto</br> the walls of the finest cafe in Paris. At the same time, however, they</br> do fulfill the most basic and primordial purpose of photography.</br> Those pictures preserve a memory. It might not be a far-reaching</br> preservation, but it is preservation nonetheless. This fixing of memory</br> has the potential to give us a measure of happiness within</br> ourselves that is no less satisfying than that felt by the first picture</br> takers over two centuries ago. The difference between us and them,</br> is that we have perhaps become numbed by the very magic they</br> helped to create.</p>

<h4>The Next Evolutionary Phase</h4>

<p>The next evolutionary phase of photography might not be a progression</br> in the way we make images. Instead, it’s quite possible the next</br> unseen horizon will come from the way we share those images with the</br> world or how we store them for ourselves. If a photograph indeed</br> captures a memory, what use is that memory unless it can more</br> tangibly recalled. Looking back in the history of photography has each</br> subsequent advancement not strived to make the photo more</br> qualitative, more lasting, and more real?</p>
