<h3>Robert frank</h3>

<p>There was never a more prolific photographer than Robert Frank. From</br> 1941, he worked as a commercial photographer in Zurich, Basel and</br> Geneva.</br>
In 1947, he found a job as a fashion photographer in the US. He used his</br> 35mm Leica, unconventional at the time. Between 1950 and ’59 he</br> turned his attention to street photography and photojournalism.</br>
This is where he became most famous. The Guggenheim Fellowship allowed</br> him to travel the country, resulting in his most famous work: The</br> Americans.</br>
He worked closely to Walker Evans and became one of the world’s most</br> famous street photographers. He completed his visuals with text,</br> written straight onto the negatives and prints.</p>

<h4>Graciela Iturbide</h4>

<p>Born in Mexico City, Graciela Iturbide studied filmmaking at the</br> Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos between 1969 and 1972,</br> and worked as an assistant to photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo,</br> who stimulated her interest in photography. She met to Henri</br> Cartier-Bresson while traveling in Europe, and in 1978, was one of the</br> founding members of the Mexican Council of Photography. Besides</br> Cartier-Bresson and Alvarez Bravo, Tina Modotti was in important</br> influence on Iturbide. A major exhibition of her work, "External</br> Encounters, Internal Imaginings: Photographs of Graciela Iturbide," was</br> presented at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in addition to</br> retrospectives at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey in</br> Mexico, and at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. A monograph on her</br> work, Graciela Iturbide: Images of the Spirit (1996), accompanied her</br> Philadelphia show.</p>

<p>Iturbide's exquisite high-contrast black-and-white prints convey the</br> starkness of life for many of her subjects. Traveling through</br> Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama, and the Mexican community of East</br> Los Angeles, Iturbide documents the uneasy cohabitation of ancient</br> cultural rituals and contemporary adaptations and interpretations. One</br> of her particular interests has been the role of women, and since</br> 1979 she has photographed the Zapotec Indians of Juchitán, Oaxaca,</br> among whom women are commonly accorded places of power, and</br> stereotypical gender roles are frequently subverted. Iturbide uses</br> photography to try to understand Mexico in its totality, as a</br> combination of indigenous practices, and imported and assimilated</br> Catholic religious practices, and foreign economic trade. Meredith</br> Fisher Handy et al.

<h5> The Cemetary</h5>

<p>This image is part of Graciela Iturbide’s series on the Juchitan</br> indigenous culture, a major focus of her work from 1979 to 1988. Located</br> in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, the Juchitan is a matriarchal</br> society in which women are in charge of everything from commerce to</br> religious ceremonies. In The Cemetery, taken in 1988, Iturbide depicts a</br> woman carrying firewood through a cemetery made up of modest adobe</br> tombs. Swallows circle around, filling the frame of the image. The</br> scene is beautifully surreal, but also foreboding. The</br> photographer creates her own reality, moving past Mexico’s Catholic</br> traditions into Indian mysticism.</p>
